# `pages` Folder

This folder contains all the pages that will be part of the application. Details on required numbers will be provided in the Phase 3 documentation.

These pages are meant to show you an example of some of the features of Streamlit and the way we will limit functionality access by role/persona. It is not meant to represent a complete application.

TODO: Describe the pages folder and include link to documentation. Don't forget about ordering of pages.

This folder contains all the Streamlit pages used to support different personas in the application. Each page corresponds to a feature tailored to one of the four user types: Store Manager, Eco-Conscious Teen, Sensory-Sensitive Shopper, and Trend-Focused Influencer.

The pages are written in Streamlit using `.py` files and are automatically ordered by numbers(e.g., `00_Store_Manager_Home.py`, `01_Product_Management_Dash.py`).

Pages 00-05 focus on Persona 1 - Mike, a Store Manager: '00_Store_Manager_Home.py'. His 3 feature pages include a Product Management Dashboard, an Order Management Dashboard, and a Catgeory Management Dashboard. Pages 10-13 focus on Persona 2 - Lia, an Eco-Conscious Teen Customer. Pages 20-23 focus on Persona 3 - Max, a Sensory Sensitive Shopper. Pages 31-34 focus on Persona 4 - Rhian, a Trend-Focused Influencer.
